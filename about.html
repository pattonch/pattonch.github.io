						<div class="bio">As a result of past laboratory research experiences and employment opportunities, I have a desire to work on cutting edge development and manufacture of new biotechnologies and medical devices.I want to be able to connect the often hidden dots between academia and the masses to provide products that can change peoples lives; developing products that can help solve the problem we face with biotechnology, pharmaceutical, and medical device manufacturing. As a result I look for work that is both intellectually challenging and satisfying. I want to work towards bringing the ideas we develop in the labs and at research institutions to a broader range of people. <br><br>New discoveries and innovations in these fields and other similar ones have large impacts on modern life; for example advancements in colon cancer treatment drugs; increased osteoinductivity in synthetic bone allografts; and new, novel materials with increased catalytic properties power our next-generation batteries. Important discoveries are happening everyday that only encourage and fuel my interest to be successful in this industry. <br><br>Since graduation from undergrad, I have worked for two companies that have provided me a range of experiences that add breadth to my understanding of the biotech and medical device industries. I started working at a Boehringer Ingelheim (BI) facility with a 12,000L capacity developing a new department designed to support all manufacturing operations, cell culture and purification. In addition to the support group I created a multistage training platform for new hires to acclimate slowly, and proposed a critical design change to a key purification step in the process in order to improve turn-around time for batch processing and reduce cleaning and sanitizing cost.<br><br>At Berkeley Advanced Biomaterials (BAB) I have consulted colleagues within BAB on developing and a Continuing Education (CE) program so our Certified Tissue Bank Specialists (CTBS) can keep the license current. I also restructured the preventive maintenance and calibration plan to simplify scheduling for both my department and the manufacturing staff that use the equipment.<br><br>In my free time I've been brewing beer with friends out of my kitchen for over two years. I have found that my interest in the work I do translates into a successful brewer! Developing and executing a new recipe requires planning and scheduling, especially on brew day. Reducing the brew time from 6 hours down to 2 or 3 hours can save you a lot of stress.<br><br>The common theme between the two highlighted work experiences and my love for beer is project focused work. While I am capable of many things, my strengths and skills are well suited for working in small teams and my drive to continually improve myself will lead me to great opportunities. I believe collaboration, creativity, and an inherent need to improve the quality of life is the key to any successful product especially in an industry that, as a whole, works to solve some of the hardest problems humans face.
